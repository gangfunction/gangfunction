**"Is this necessary?" and "How can this concept move?"**

## How I Think

**Merge**: Find sameness in many.  
**Split**: Unpack what's bundled.  
**Classify**: Choose what distinguishes.  
**Map**: Preserve structure across.

The hardest part is "how to move."

## Recently

Made it complex. Regretted.  
Made it simple. Satisfied.  
Made it fast. Mistaken.

Some things are worse than nothing.

## Now

Ask "Is this necessary?" first  
Deep over wide
